								<h2>About us!</h2>
								<p>We are a small group of maids with years of experience in cleaning. We decided to embrace our entrepreneurial spirit and create our own business. Our goals are simply to do really quality cleaning and maintain great connections with our clients.</p>
								<h2>How does the cleaning service work?</h2>
								<p>First comes our super simple sign-up process. Fill out a basic form (5 minutes) and weâ€™ll reach out to you via the preferred method to confirm times.</p>
								<p>Next, a week before your scheduled cleaning, we will send you a reminder and an invoice via email. You must pay the invoice at least a day before the cleaning. If no payment has gone through we will contact you to notify you of the canceled cleaning.</p>
								<p>We are working on setting up autopayments! Stay tuned!</p>
								<p>Next, we will knock on your door! If you choose to leave your residence at the time of cleaning please leave the residence unlocked or provide your maid with a key.</p>
								<p>Then we will start cleaning! We will: Wipe windows, wipe surfaces, wipe appliances, wipe screens, vacuum the floor, sweep, mop, and take out the trash. We will do cleaning all your spaces, including your kitchen and bathroom. We provide trash bags.</p>
								<p>Depending on the size of your space this may take some time. Make sure you plan accordingly.</p>
								<p>We also will do additional requests ranging from $20-$75. These include items like cleaning the interior of a stove, scrubbing baseboards, and spot cleaning the walls.</p>
								<p>Then you are good to enjoy your clean home!</p>
